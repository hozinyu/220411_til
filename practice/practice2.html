          We got it started in the worst way <br />
          Just by the way you looked at me<br />
          Goddamn, it was a spectacle<br />
          We look <span class="wow">fuckin'</span> incredible now<br />
          It was a <strong class="title">" car crash "</strong><br />
          Two colors cross the intersect<br />
          Red light wasn't the problem<br />
          The stop sign drew us deeper in<br />
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          Chase me out of your bed just to tell me,
          <span class="comeback">" Come back "</span><br />
          And the signals were mixed, so we <em class="boom">crashed</em><br />
          Your bloodshot eyes tell me when<br />
          All the warring has ended,
          <strong class="end"> it was beautiful</strong> <br />
